# PsychWiki
Welcome to PsychWiki! An unofficial improved wiki for Psych Engine. Its main goal is to documenting missing functions, improving descriptions with high quality descriptions with examples, and what not. This wiki was made because the official wiki hasn't been updated for a while, so I decided to create thos wikiâ€”cuz why the hell not? Ironically the official wiki has been updated, which is funny and awkward at the same time.
