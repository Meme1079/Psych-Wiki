# PsychWiki
Welcome to PsychWiki! An unofficial wiki for Psych Engine. Created in August 4, 2022â€”its main goal is to documenting missing functions with improved descriptions including examples and references. It was created due to the official Psych Engine wiki not being updated at that time. So I decided to create this wiki for that specific reason.


### Current Update [17.0.0 (Christmas) Version]
