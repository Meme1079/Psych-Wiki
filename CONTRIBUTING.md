# Introduction
When contrubuting this repostory you must abide these rule and follow the formating.

# Rules
1. The subject must be 100% related to Psych Engine not other engines. This repository is to document missing stuff not mentioned on the wiki. If you did not abide this you have low common sence and an IQ.
2. If you're adding a lua function please double check if the function actually exists in Psych Engine.
3. The Lua version that Psych Engine is using is `5.1`. So please don't add lua functions or lua features above `5.1`. 
4. If you're doing a useless pull request/issue I will mark it as `invalid`. I don't even know why you're trolling this repository there are less people to troll here.
5. If you're doing a pull request make sure it's in the `experimental-branch-thingy` branch for obvious reasons.
6. And Lastly follow the format shown below becuase i said so. _(such a good responce ðŸ˜Ž)_

# Formating
## Defualt Function Format:
````md
### functionName(parName1:Type, ?parName2:Type, parName3:Type = Value, ?parName4:Type = Value, #parName5:Type)
Function decription. _(Your dumb comments, this is optional)_

> [!NOTE]  
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

- `parameter3` - An optional parameter, Description; Defualt value: `value`.
- `parameter4` - An optional parameter, Description; Defualt value: `value`.
- `parameter5` - An infinite parameter, Description. <!-- If the parameter is an infinite type -->

Example:
```lua
-- stupid code of yours
```
````

## Defualt Group Format:
```md
# Group Name Function
### functionName1(parameters)
### functionName2(parameters)
### functionName3(parameters)

***

# Another Group Function
```

## Using Font Styles
- `<code>` - Use this if you're reffering to programming languages like `lua`. Or data types like `string`, `table`, `boolean`, etc. Parameters and functions are also included examples: `functionName()` and `param`.
- `<ins>` - Use this for highlighting on really important description parts; Example: This stupid function <ins>does this</ins>.
- `<kbd>` - Use this if you're using single characters, commands, versions; Example: <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>5</kbd>, <kbd>%</kbd>, <kbd>Command + S</kbd>
